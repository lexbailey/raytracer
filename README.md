# Raytracer

A really crappy ray tracer written in python 3

## Incomplete work

This raytracer is not complete. It is very slow and it only renders one hard-coded scene.

I wrote this as an excercise in computer graphics, it is not meant to be useful. 

## Installation

- Clone the repo

```
git clone git@github.com:danieljabailey/raytracer.git
```

 - Initialise the venv

```
cd raytracer
./initvenv.sh
source venv/bin/activate # or similar, for your shell (e.g. activate.fish)
```
(This will create a venv and install the dependencies in the venv)

Don't forget to source the activate script each time you start developing or using the raytracer.

## Running the raytracer

To run the raytracer;

    python -m Raytracer
